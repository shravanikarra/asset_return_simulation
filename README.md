# asset_return_simulation
ðŸ“‹ Overview

This project addresses the limitations of traditional asset return simulation methods used for long-term investment projections. Current industry practices largely depend on assuming log-normal distributions for daily returns and annualizing themâ€”a method that often misrepresents crucial real-world characteristics such as fat tails, serial correlations, and varying behaviors across asset classes.

Our project delivers enhanced methodologies to simulate asset return paths that better reflect historical and structural market behaviors, providing the client with more robust tools for forecasting, risk assessment, and portfolio planning.

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

The traditional simulation approach:
	â€¢	Assumes log-normal distribution of daily returns.
	â€¢	Uses scaling laws to convert daily returns to annual projections.

Key Issues:
	â€¢	Underestimates fat tails and extreme events.
	â€¢	Fails to capture trend persistence and serial correlation.
	â€¢	Misses volatility clustering and regime changes.
	â€¢	Ignores cross-asset dependencies beyond linear correlation.

These limitations lead to misleading risk-return estimates and unreliable long-term projections, particularly in diversified portfolios and products with path-dependent payoffs.

ðŸ”§ Our Approach

Methodologies Implemented:
	1.	Block Bootstrapping of Returns
	â€¢	Preserves autocorrelation and volatility patterns by resampling historical blocks.
	2.	GARCH-based Time Series Simulation
	â€¢	Models time-varying volatility to better capture clustering and tail risk.
	3.	Empirical Distribution Monte Carlo
	â€¢	Non-parametric simulation using the actual historical return distribution.
	4.	Copula-based Multi-Asset Simulation
	â€¢	Captures non-linear dependencies and joint tail behavior between asset classes.

ðŸ“Š Tools & Technologies Used
	â€¢	Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels, Arch, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
	â€¢	Jupyter Notebook
	â€¢	Financial time-series modeling libraries

ðŸ“ˆ Key Deliverables
	â€¢	Enhanced return path simulation models.
	â€¢	Comparative analysis vs traditional log-normal approaches.
	â€¢	Recommendations for integration into the clientâ€™s projection tools.
	â€¢	Visualizations demonstrating the difference in outcomes, tail risks, and volatility persistence.
